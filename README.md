# Javascript30

Short exercises from the [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) by WesBos.  
I'll publish the exercises as I follow them. They can be seen [here](https://joaquincasal.github.io/Javascript30/). They're published using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

These is what I have by now:

- [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://joaquincasal.github.io/Javascript30/01-Drumkit)
- [JS and CSS Clock](https://joaquincasal.github.io/Javascript30/02-Clock)
